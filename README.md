# nvim-config

neovim config, 90% copied from https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch/. Repo's here to track my custom plugins, keymaps, etc., since I wanted to write the config from scratch without starting from a fork of the original.

Install with `git clone git@github.com:kanyesthaker/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim`.
